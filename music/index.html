    <p>
        I've been making music for 8 years now, I have hundreds of tracks on my hard drives, dozens are lost on the Internet and to be frank, I like some of these songs.
        Not to mention that I made a lot of covers or visuals for unreleased tracks, all of it never saw the light of day.

        In summary, this page will archive all music related stuff i've been making through these years.

    <h2 id="subtitle">What kind of music do you produce?</h2>

    <p>
        I mainly produce <i>Hard Dance</i> music, more specifically <b>Acidcore, Hardcore</b> and a little bit of Hardtek (I don't like the kick tho)
