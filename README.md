## Landing page for the exposedlan project. WIP

This repository hosts my website's landing page, which links my blog ([source available on my github](https://github.com/exposedlan/exposedlan-blog)), my music projects page (TO-DO), and my archival website (I already made good poart of it using [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) but i don't like the result, therefore i'll probably remake it from scratch in pure HTML and CSS).

font used for website's header is [SpeakEasy](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/sf-speakeasy)
